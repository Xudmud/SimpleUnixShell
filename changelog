+Implemented exit code support. The shell will now print the exit code of the
 last executed command before the prompt. In the case of a pipe, the shell
 prints the result of the last command in the pipe.

For the future:
Still researching interpreter support.

Expand on cd to hold oldpwd

Try to set up tab completion. (if 'tab' is pressed, use the current text to do
a str.contains() or equivalent on the directories in PATH (or pwd), display
results?)

Restructure shell and modularize each portion.


Personal notes:
More and more I'm understanding why the bash sourcecode is so many files.

+Changed how the wait() command is implemented, so an input file that is larger
 than the pipe buffer no longer causes a deadlock.

+Implemented basic cd support. The command requires an argument to the relative
 or absolute path of the directory to change to.
 TODO:  -Implement support for an argumentless cd to go to home directory.
        -Implement support for ~ as an alias for /home/<user>


For the future:
Since apparently there's more to implementing a shell as an interpreter than
just feeding it a bunch of commands in a file (should have been obvious),
research how to set up the shell as an interpreter.

Look into grabbing exit codes from the programs that run, if possible.
